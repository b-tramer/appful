APPFUL

This site is a solution for rating and reviewing other web-based applications. Those interested in tracking, sharing, reviewing and rating other web sites can do so by registering for an account at Appful. As an Appful user, you can can gain access to a community of users interested in innovative web-based applications both from a design perspective and a user perspective. Many of us have come across interesting lesser-known sites and wish to share them as well as comment from a users’ perspective. We all depend on sites that work; they get the job done, but could be improved and suggestions for improvements can benefit developers. And sometimes, sites we love and use regularly need the acknowledgments and praises of their user base.
